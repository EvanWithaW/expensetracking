# This is a WIP brand-new repository for my work on a student expense tracking application.

## The goal of this project is to:

- Create a standalone Spring application which can create, edit, remove, and show expenses.
- Provide valuable information into spending habits (i.e: monthly goals vs how much spent)
- Create a working and interactive front-end using ReactJS which interacts with this repository (expensetracking-frontend)

## What I hope to accomplish after achieving these goals:

- Create a login and registration interface (using Spring Security) so individual students can register and track their expenses {working on using article: https://medium.com/@tericcabrel/implement-jwt-authentication-in-a-spring-boot-3-application-5839e4fd8fac as a guide}
- Allow students to share their progress on a 'social media' esque feed.
